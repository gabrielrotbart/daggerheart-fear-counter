- building an owlbear rodeo extension
- A **fear tracker for RPG Daggerheart**
- The design example is in tracker-example.png
- Snake svg is public/snake-spiral.svg
- The tracker allows the DM to **drag** each snake from one side of the **counter rail** to the other side.

  - The snakes on the right side indicate how much **active fear** the DM has.
  - The snakes on the left side indicate how much **inactive fear** the DM has

- Build the first version of the above tracker in typescript.
- Allow drag and drop of the snakes but forcing them to stay on the \*_counter-rail_
