Add the following feature:

- In order to make it easier to move tokens from the **inactive side** to the **active side** we want to allow grabbing multiple tokens
- Going from right to left:
  - if the user grabs the first token from the right, we're going to grab 1 token
  - if the user grabs the 2nd token from the right, we'll grab 2 tokens
  - if the user grabs the 2nd token from the right, we'll grab 2 tokens
  - if the user grabs the 3red token from the right, we'll grab 3 tokens
  - so on...
